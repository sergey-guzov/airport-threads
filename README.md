There are 5 runways at the airport. It takes 3 minutes for an airplane to enter the runway, gain speed and take off. 
After that, the runway is free for the next airplane to take off. 
Simulate the departure of 10 airplanes using all available runways. 
Replace 1 minute of real time with 1 second in the simulation.
